This lab report aims to search for evidence supporting the existence of the sterile neutrino, using
data from the Fermilab MicroBooNE experiment. Using machine learning, we categorise the detected
particles from their track data, identifying the muon neutrinos ($\nu_\mu$). The
energy distribution of these $\nu_\mu$ is then compared to Monte Carlo simulation data which includes the
sterile neutrino. The $\chi^2$ of this for different parameters of the sterile neutrino was calculated, 
excluding a large region of the parameter space at 90\% confidence. This coincided well with the
inclusion regions at 90\% from data gathered in the previous neutrino experiments LSND and MiniBooNE.

\section{Introduction}

The MicroBooNE experiment at Fermilab consists of a 170-ton liquid-argon time projection chamber 
(LArTPC)\cite{microboone},
which allows the detection of neutrinos originating from the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB). One of the key
aims of this expriment is to further investigate the $4.8\sigma$ low-energy neutrino excess found in the
previous MiniBooNE experiment\cite{miniboone_excess}. \\

One proposed explanation for this excess is a fourth neutrino flavour -- the sterile neutrino. Using 
data from MicroBooNE, we will attempt to exclude regions of the possible parameter space for the
properties of this proposed new particle.

\section{Theory}

\subsection{Neutrino Flavour Oscillation}

A neutrino is a type of lepton that only interacts via the weak force. They have three flavours in
the Standard Model, labelled $\nu_e$, $\nu_\mu$, and $\nu_\tau$. Due to the fact that the neutrino
flavour and mass eigenstates for the are not the same, a neutrino produced in one flavour state may be
detected as a different flavour. The flavour and mass eigenstates are related by the PMNS matrix\cite{pmns}, 
which for a simple two-flavour model is
\begin{equation}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \nu_\alpha \\ \nu_\beta
    \end{pmatrix}
    = \begin{pmatrix}
        \cos{\theta} & \sin{\theta} \\
        -\sin{\theta} & \cos{\theta}
    \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
        \nu_1 \\ \nu_2
    \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the mixing angle between the mass and flavour eigenstates. The flavour components
are $\nu_\alpha$ and $\nu_\beta$, and the mass components are $\nu_1$ and $\nu_2$. The probability of a
flavour disappearance (a change of flavour away from the original) in this model is given by 
\begin{equation}
    P(\alpha \to \beta) = \sin^2{\left(2\theta\right)}\sin^2{\left(1.27 \frac{\Delta m_{12}^2 L}{E}\right)},
    \label{eqn:mixing_prob}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta m_{12}$ is the difference in the two neutrino masses in eV, $L$ is the distance
travelled in km, and $E$ is the energy of neutrino in GeV.

\subsection{Sterile Neutrino}

This analysis is investigating the existence of the sterile neutrino, so a four-flavour model is
required. The full treatment of this would be complex, so the short-baseline approximation will be
used -- assuming that the oscillation distance is short, and the sterile neutrino has a much greater
mass than the other three neutrinos. This allows most terms of the probability to be dropped.\\

From this, a formula similar to \autoref{eqn:mixing_prob} for the muon neutrino survival probability
is obtained.
\begin{equation}
    P(\nu_\mu \to \nu_\mu) \approx 1 - \sin^2{\left(2\theta_{\mu\mu}\right)} 
    \sin^2{\left(1.27 \frac{\Delta m_{14}^2 L}{E}\right)},
    \label{eqn:survival_prob}
\end{equation}
where $\theta_{\mu\mu}$ is an effective mixing angle for muon neutrino survival, $\Delta m_{14}$
is the mass difference between the electron and sterile neutrino in eV, and the other symbols
have the same meaning as in \autoref{eqn:mixing_prob}. The electron-sterile neutrino mass difference
has been used due to the previously stated assumption that the sterile neutrino has a much greater
mass than the other neutrinos. Hence, $\Delta m_{14} \approx \Delta m_{24} \approx \Delta m_{34}$.\\

Other experiments typically investigate electron neutrino appearance, so
$\theta_{\mu e}$ -- the effective mixing angle for electron neutrino appearance, is required for
better comparison. This can be obtained from $\theta_{\mu\mu}$ through
\begin{equation}
    \sin^2{\left(2\theta_{\mu e}\right)} = \left(1 - \left|\cos{\left(2\theta_{\mu\mu}\right)} \right|\right)
    \left(1 - \left|\cos{\left(2\theta_{14}\right)}\right|\right),
\end{equation}
where $\theta_{14}$ is the electron-sterile neutrino mixing angle. From MicroBooNE data, the
best-fit value for this parameter was determined as 
$\sin^2{\left(2\theta_{14}\right)} = 0.240$\cite{uboone_angle}.

\section{Experiment Setup}

The neutrinos in the BNB are predominantly muon neutrinos. These are sent towards the LArTPC of
MicroBooNE, where some will with the argon via the weak interaction, for example a charged current
interaction as shown in \autoref{fig:cc_interaction}. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{feynman}
        \diagram[horizontal=a to b] {
            i1 [particle=\(\nu_\mu\)] -- [fermion] a -- [fermion] f1 [particle=\(\mu^-\)],
            i2 [particle=\(n\)] -- [fermion] b -- [fermion] f2 [particle=\(p\)],
            a -- [boson, edge label=\(W^+\)] b,
        };
    \end{feynman}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{A Feynmann diagram for a charged current muon neutrino interaction. A muon neutrino
    exchanges a $W^+$ boson with a neutron, emitting a muon and a proton.}
    \label{fig:cc_interaction}
\end{figure}

In this case, the outgoing muon will ionise electrons
from nearby atoms, which drift towards the sense wires due to an applied electric field. This
produces a current in the sense wires, allowing 3D reconstruction of the muon particle track.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{A diagram showing the setup of the LArTPC and the sense
    wires used to detect particle tracks. Credit: MicroBooNE collaboration\cite{microboone_tpc}.}
\end{figure}

From this raw track data, a number of direct measurements are made such as: track length,
start position, and end position. The initial interaction vertex is also reconstructed as this may
not always be at the start of a track\cite{interaction_vertex}. From track data, the neutrino's
energy can also be reconstructed. For muon tracks, as shown in \autoref{fig:muon_track}, they are
long and straight, making the muon momentum easy to reconstruct as well.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{img/uboone_muon_event.png}
    \caption{An example muon track from real data at MicroBooNE. Credit: Fermilab.}
    \label{fig:muon_track}
\end{figure}

Machine learning can be applied to these data points to categorise tracks, enabling the distinction
between e.g. cosmic muon tracks, or electron showers (indicating a $\nu_e$). We are interested in
detecting $\nu_\mu$ originating from the beam only, so the machine learning used will focus on
identifying this, classifying everything else as background.

\section{Results}

The preprocessed data from the MicroBooNE experiment includes many of the calculated values
discussed previously, along with two machine learning confidence scores between 0 and 1. One for
identifying a muon track, and one for identifying an electron shower. \\

There is also Monte Carlo simulation data, combined with external data (the data gathered when the
beam is off). The Monte Carlo data has no flavour oscillation applied, so that this can be varied
for different properties of the sterile neutrino.\\

The first step in the analysis of this data is to make some basic cuts to remove non-physical data 
(for example where energy couldn't be reconstructed). Also to cut data recorded in the
outer-fiducial volume (10\;cm around the edge), where edge effects are the most prominent. Beyond
this, other cuts can be made to remove regions of the parameter space with a large percentage of
background data, as checked in the Monte Carlo simulation data. \\

More sophisticated analysis involved training a neural network on the Monte Carlo data to identify
a $\nu_\mu$ CC track. With all of the data cuts and the classification of the neural network, the
data can be split into signal and background as shown in \autoref{fig:signal_background}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \input{plots/energy_plot.pgf}  
    \caption{A histogram plot of how the energy of the detected particles is distributed, showing
    the categorisation between signal ($\nu_\mu$ CC interactions) in blue and the background data 
    in red.}
    \label{fig:signal_background}
\end{figure}

With the signal data identified, the Monte Carlo data can be modified to include the survival
probability from \autoref{eqn:survival_prob}. Calculating the $\chi^2$ between the Monte Carlo and 
real data, across the parameter space of
possible $\theta_{\mu e}$ and $\Delta m_{14}^2$, we can exclude regions of the parameter space. A
15\% systematic error on the energy is used, along with the Poisson statistical error. The region we
excluded is shown in \autoref{fig:exclusion}.

    \centering
    \input{plots/figure.pgf}   
    \caption{A plot of the parameter space for the hypothetical sterile neutrino. The possible
    regions (at 90\% confidence) by LSND and MiniBooNE are shown, along with the calculated
    excluded region at 90\% confidence for MicroBooNE data (red line).}
    \label{fig:exclusion}
\end{figure}

\section{Discussion}

As seen in \autoref{fig:exclusion}, we have excluded (at 90\% confidence) a large region of the
parameter space for the sterile neutrino. This region is also in good agreement with the 90\% inclusion
regions from both LSND and MiniBooNE. Regions towards zero in both parameters could not be excluded due
to the nature of the data. The Monte Carlo data was below the real data, and hence any oscillation
applied worsened the fit. Despite this, there is a large inclusion region due to the large systematic
errors used. \\

The systematic error was a large limitation of this analysis. The value of 15\%
is quite high, and also applied uniformly across all energy ranges which is a conservative
estimate. If this systematic error could be reduced, more sensitivity, and better exclusion regions
could be obtained. \\

Using muon neutrino disappearance rather than electron neutrino appearance also helps due to the greater
number compared to electron neutrinos. This gives greater statistical significance to the results.


\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, the sterile neutrino still represents promising potential for physics beyond the
standard model, attempting to explain the $4.8\sigma$ low-energy excess observed in the MiniBooNE
experiment. Using muon neutrino disappearance, rather than electron neutrino appearance, we have
shown good agreement between our 90\% confidence exclusion region, and the 90\% inclusion regions of
LSND and MiniBooNE.\\

While this neither proves nor disproves the existence of the sterile neutrino, it provides
additional data to help narrow down future searches.
